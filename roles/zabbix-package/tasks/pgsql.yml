  pip:
      #virtualenv: undefined # not required. An optional path to a I(virtualenv) directory to install into. It cannot be specified together with the 'executable' parameter (added in 2.1). If the virtualenv does not exist, it will be created before installing packages. The optional virtualenv_site_packages, virtualenv_command, and virtualenv_python options affect the creation of the virtualenv.
      #virtualenv_site_packages: no # not required. Whether the virtual environment will inherit packages from the global site-packages directory.  Note that if this setting is changed on an already existing virtual environment it will not have any effect, the environment must be deleted and newly created.
      #virtualenv_command: virtualenv # not required. The command or a pathname to the command to create the virtual environment with. For example C(pyvenv), C(virtualenv), C(virtualenv2), C(~/bin/virtualenv), C(/usr/local/bin/virtualenv).
      #chdir: undefined # not required. cd into this directory before running the command
      #requirements: undefined # not required. The path to a pip requirements file, which should be local to the remote system. File can be specified as a relative path if using the chdir option.
      name: psycopg2-binary # not required. The name of a Python library to install or the url(bzr+,hg+,git+,svn+) of the remote package.,This can be a list (since 2.2) and contain version specifiers (since 2.7).
      #virtualenv_python: undefined # not required. The Python executable used for creating the virtual environment. For example C(python3.5), C(python2.7). When not specified, the Python version used to run the ansible module is used. This parameter should not be used when C(virtualenv_command) is using C(pyvenv) or the C(-m venv) module.
      #editable: no # not required. Pass the editable flag.
      #umask: undefined # not required. The system umask to apply before installing the pip package. This is useful, for example, when installing on systems that have a very restrictive umask by default (e.g., 0077) and you want to pip install packages which are to be used by all users. Note that this requires you to specify desired umask mode in octal, with a leading 0 (e.g., 0077).
      executable: pip3 # not required. The explicit executable or a pathname to the executable to be used to run pip for a specific version of Python installed in the system. For example C(pip-3.3), if there are both Python 2.7 and 3.3 installations in the system and you want to run pip for the Python 3.3 installation. It cannot be specified together with the 'virtualenv' parameter (added in 2.1). By default, it will take the appropriate version for the python interpreter use by ansible, e.g. pip3 on python 3, and pip2 or pip on python 2.
      #extra_args: undefined # not required. Extra arguments passed to pip.
      state: present # not required. choices: absent;forcereinstall;latest;present. The state of module,The 'forcereinstall' option is only available in Ansible 2.1 and above.

      name: zabbix # required. Name of the user (role) to add or remove.
      #ssl_rootcert: undefined # not required. Specifies the name of a file containing SSL certificate authority (CA) certificate(s). If the file exists, the server's certificate will be verified to be signed by one of these authorities.
      #ssl_mode: disable # not required. choices: disable;allow;prefer;require;verify-ca;verify-full. Determines whether or with what priority a secure SSL TCP/IP connection will be negotiated with the server.,See U(https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-ssl.html) for more information on the modes.,Default of C(prefer) matches libpq default.
      login_user: postgres # not required. User (role) used to authenticate with PostgreSQL.
      login_host: "{{db_login_host}}" # not required. Host running PostgreSQL.
      #expires: undefined # not required. The date at which the user's password is to expire.,If set to C('infinity'), user's password never expire.,Note that this value should be a valid SQL date and time type.

      login_password: undefined # not required. Password used to authenticate with PostgreSQL.
      password: zabbix # not required. Set the user's password, before 1.4 this was required.,Password can be passed unhashed or hashed (MD5-hashed).,Unhashed password will automatically be hashed when saved into the database if C(encrypted) parameter is set, otherwise it will be save in plain text format.,When passing a hashed password it must be generated with the format C('str["md5"] + md5[ password + username ]'), resulting in a total of 35 characters. An easy way to do this is C(echo "md5$(echo -n 'verysecretpasswordJOE' | md5sum)").,Note that if the provided password string is already in MD5-hashed format, then it is used as-is, regardless of C(encrypted) parameter.
      port: 5432 # not required. Database port to connect to.
      #fail_on_user: yes # not required. If C(yes), fail when user can't be removed. Otherwise just log and continue.
      #priv: undefined # not required. PostgreSQL privileges string in the format: C(table:priv1,priv2).
      #no_password_changes: no # not required. If C(yes), don't inspect database for password changes. Effective when C(pg_authid) is not accessible (such as AWS RDS). Otherwise, make password changes as necessary.
      state: present # not required. choices: present;absent. The user (role) state.
      encrypted: yes # not required. Whether the password is stored hashed in the database. Passwords can be passed already hashed or unhashed, and postgresql ensures the stored password is hashed when C(encrypted) is set.,Note: Postgresql 10 and newer doesn't support unhashed passwords.,Previous to Ansible 2.6, this was C(no) by default.
      role_attr_flags: "CREATEDB,SUPERUSER" # not required. choices: [NO]SUPERUSER;[NO]CREATEROLE;[NO]CREATEDB;[NO]INHERIT;[NO]LOGIN;[NO]REPLICATION;[NO]BYPASSRLS. PostgreSQL role attributes string in the format: CREATEDB,CREATEROLE,SUPERUSER.,Note that '[NO]CREATEUSER' is deprecated.

      owner: zabbix # not required. Name of the role to set as owner of the database
      state: restore # not required. choices: present;absent;dump;restore. The database state. present implies that the database should be created if necessary.

  #dump requires a target definition to which the database will be backed up.

  #(Added in 2.4) The format of the backup will be detected based on the target name.
